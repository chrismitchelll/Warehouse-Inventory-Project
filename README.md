# Warehouse-Inventory-Project

In-Stock is a full-stack warehouse inventory simulator which allows for the viewing, creating, editing & deleting of Warehouses and their inventory lists by the end user.

This project was created as part of the BrainStation Web Development bootcamp, over a weekend within a group.
